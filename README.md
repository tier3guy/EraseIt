# EraseIt – Background Remover

### A React-based web application that removes the background from your images.  

Using this application is very simple: just click the `Browse` button to select your image or drag and drop the image onto the upload area. The app automatically detects and uploads your image to the server. Processing typically takes 10–15 seconds, after which you can download your image with the background removed.
